# Portable Julia Environment

This is a simple docker setup that I can easily spin up and down as needed. It is also useful for anyone who doesn't want to go through the setup of julia on their personal machine. 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

and 

```bash
docker-compose down
```

when you are completed.
